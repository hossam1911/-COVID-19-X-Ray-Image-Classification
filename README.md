# COVID-19 Chest X-Ray Image Classification

## Overview
The coronavirus pandemic has led to a global health crisis, with the need for rapid and accurate detection of COVID-19 infections. This project focuses on utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance the screening of COVID-19 cases through chest X-ray images.

According to Chowdhury et al. (2020), X-ray imaging is a readily available tool for diagnosing COVID-19 cases. However, distinguishing COVID-19 from other viral cases of pneumonia is challenging due to similarities in the images. This project aims to explore the potential of AI in efficiently and accurately detecting COVID-19 from chest X-ray images.

The dataset comprises a total of 21,165 samples categorized into four main classes:

1. Covid-19
2. Lung Opacity
3. Normal
4. Viral Pneumonia

All images are in Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format, with a resolution of 299x299 pixels. The dataset currently includes 3,616 COVID-19 positive cases, 10,192 Normal cases, 6,012 Lung Opacity (Non-COVID lung infection) cases, and 1,345 Viral Pneumonia cases.
